<h1>Week 11: Data Race Detection in Practice<a class="headerlink" href="#week-11-data-race-detection-in-practice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this mini research project you’ll be working in groups of two. The
goal of this project is to get you exposed to the state-of-the-art
tools for finding concurrency bugs in large Java codebases.</p>
<p>You are not required to be proficient in Java in order to complete
this project, but you are expected to understand the meaning of Java’s
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">synchronized</span></code> keyword and be able to follow the structure of class
definitions. Given your knowledge of Scala, figuring out those
relations should be trivial.</p>
<div class="section" id="background-data-races-in-java">
<h2>Background: Data Races in Java<a class="headerlink" href="#background-data-races-in-java" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the previous lectures of this module, we’ve been primarily
concerned with implementations of non-trivial concurrent data
structures and algorithms, most of which feature a form of “racing”
between threads. Such fenomena, called <cite>race conditions</cite> occur
frequently when multiple concurrent threads try to simultaneously
perform a certain operations (e.g., grab a lock).</p>
<p>However, if the threads are racing over a memory location that is not
synchronised (i.e., it is not implemented by means of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AtomicInteger</span></code> or a similar class, or isn’t protected by a lock),
it almost certainly indicates a bug in the implementation. For instance,
consider the examples in the lectures, in which a counter has been
inconsistently incremented due to the missing locks. This situation is
commonly referred to as a <cite>data race</cite>.</p>
<p>According to Oracle’s <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19205-01/820-0619/geojs/index.html">official documentation</a>, a
<strong>data race</strong> in concurrent Java code occurs when:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>two or more threads in a single process access the same memory
location (i.e., a mutable field of an object) concurrently, and</li>
<li>at least one of the accesses is for writing, and</li>
<li>the threads are not using any exclusive locks to control their
accesses to that memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>When these three conditions hold, the order of accesses is
non-deterministic, and the computation may give different results from
run to run depending on that order. Some data-races may be benign (for
example, when the memory access is used to implement locks via fields
marked as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">volatile</span></code>), but many data-races are bugs in the program.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, both notions of <cite>race conditions</cite> and <cite>data races</cite> are
frequently confused. You might find <a class="reference external" href="https://dzone.com/articles/race-condition-vs-data-race">this blog post</a> helpful to
disambiguate these definitions and acquire some extra intuition on
what should be considered data races. In practice, programmers very
rarely implement their own synchronisation mechanisms, and instead
rely on library constructions, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ReentrantLock</span></code>. Therefore,
about 90% of the concurrent code written “in the wild” uses standard
synchronisation mechanisms, and most of the concurrency-related bugs
are, in fact, data races introduced because of a missing
synchronisation.</p>
<p>Luckily for the humanity, such data races often can be identified in
an automated way via tools for <cite>static program analysis</cite>. This project
is dedicated to interaction with one of such tools.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-tool-facebook-infer">
<h2>The Tool: Facebook Infer<a class="headerlink" href="#the-tool-facebook-infer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will be using <a class="reference external" href="https://fbinfer.com">Facebook Infer</a> as a tool for
static data race detection in large Java projects. Infer provides a
large suite of analyses for Java code, but we will only need its data
race detector, known as <strong>RacerD</strong>. You can find the necessary
documentation on installing and using the relevant parts of Infer by
the following links:</p>

</ul>
<p>As a part of this assignment, please, check out the following research
paper, which introduces pragmatics of Infer’s RacerD component and
provides a number of examples. You don’t have to understand all the
details of Section 5 or follow the specifics of the experiments, just
look for a general intuition on how the analysis reports data races.</p>

<h2>Example of a Racy Java Class<a class="headerlink" href="#example-of-a-racy-java-class" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As an example of a simple data race, consider the following Java code:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In order to compile this code to JVM’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.class</span></code> binary file, you
need to save it in the file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Racy.java</span></code> and then invoke the
following command from the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">javac</span> <span class="nc">Racy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">java</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The code should compile without errors.</p>
<p>The class <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Racy</span></code> can be potentially used as a library in a
multi-threaded environment (which is determined by the fat that it has
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">synchronized</span></code> modifiers in it), and, as such, it contains a data
race, manifested by some of involved objects’ mutable fields being
potentially accessed without synchronisation.</p>
<p>To confirm that, let’s delete the compiled <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.class</span></code> file and re-run
the compilation of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Racy.java</span></code> with Infer/RacerD:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">infer</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">racerd</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">only</span> <span class="o">--</span> <span class="n">javac</span> <span class="nc">Racy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">java</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The following is printed to the output:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Found 1 issue

Racy.java:19: error: THREAD_SAFETY_VIOLATION

  Read/Write race. Non-private method `void B.haha(int)` reads
  without synchronization from `this.B.myA`. Potentially races with
  write in method `B.haz(...)`.
  Reporting because another access to the same memory occurs on a
  background thread, although this access may not.

  21.   }
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This indicates that a call of the method <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">haha()</span></code> may create a race,
when, e.g., invoked concurrently with the (correctly synchronised)
method <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">haz()</span></code> of the same object.</p>
<p>The result of the analysis will be printed to the console and also
recorded in the locally created file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">infer-out/bugs.txt</span></code>.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Can you suggest how we could fix this issue by
introducing more synchronisation?</p>

<h2>The Task<a class="headerlink" href="#the-task" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your goal for in this assignment is to hunt donw and explore data
races in large real-world Java projects. A list of some of such
projects is given below, but you may also find some on your own.</p>
<p>Working in groups of two, by using Infer/RacerD you will have to
locate <strong>five distinct</strong> data races in one or more large projects,
explain the reasons why the analyser considers them such, and provide
a tentative solution on how they could be fixed. If the races cannot
be fixed easily (e.g., just by declaring a Java method as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">synchronized</span></code>), outline your ideas on what prevents one from doing
so. The result of your project should a be PDF document that contains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A short report on the chosen Java projects. For instance, which
parts of the projects utilise concurrency, and why do you think it
is beneficial there?</li>
<li>Descriptions of 5 data races (possibly spanning multiple projects),
each complemented with a short story as described above. Some
variations on what is reported are possibler and are described below.</li>
<li>If applicable, a quick enumeration of the technical issues
encountered while working on this project (to help the future
generations).</li>

<h2>Running RacerD on Custom Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#running-racerd-on-custom-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The suggested large projects can be built from scratch using one of
the following three build-systems for Java. Make sure that the
necessary build tool is installed and can be run from the command
line. In most of the cases it can be done simply by using the package
manager of your operating system (e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">brew</span></code> for Mac OS X). The
kind of build system used by a particular project is determined by a
<cite>building descriptor file</cite> (or simply <cite>buildfile</cite>) that can be located
in the project root folder:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html">Ant</a> (buildfile
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build.xml</span></code>) — one of the oldest build systems for Java, which
is rarely used nowadays. In order to build a project, you typically
only need to run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ant</span></code> from the terminal. To remove all compiled
files, run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ant</span> <span class="pre">clean</span></code>.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://maven.apache.org/install.html">Maven</a> (buildfile
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pom.xml</span></code>) — a more advanced build system, similar in spirit to
Scala’s SBT. To compile a project, run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mvn</span> <span class="pre">compile</span></code>. To clean the
project from the results of the compilation, run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mvn</span> <span class="pre">clean</span></code>.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://gradle.org/install/">Gradle</a> (buildfile <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build.gradle</span></code>)
— a build system based on the Groovy programming language. To
build, run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">./gradlew</span> <span class="pre">build</span></code> from the project root. To clean, run
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">./gradlew</span> <span class="pre">clean</span></code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README</span></code> files of the corresponding projects for specific
instructions.</p>
<p>To make Infer/RacerD analyse a custom project, you need to “attach” it
to the compilation process. To do so, make sure that you run it on a
project that has not been compiled yet (or whose compiled files have
been removed via, e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ant</span> <span class="pre">clean</span></code> in the case of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ant</span></code>). If you
don’t ensure this, RacerD will most likely not report any results. To
run the analysis attached to a building process, run the following
command:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">infer</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">racerd</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">only</span> <span class="o">--</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">build</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">command</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;build-command&gt;</span></code> should be the corresponding command for a
particular build system, for instance:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">infer</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">racerd</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">only</span> <span class="o">--</span> <span class="n">ant</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">infer</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">racerd</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">only</span> <span class="o">--</span> <span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">compile</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">infer</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">racerd</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">only</span> <span class="o">--</span> <span class="o">./</span><span class="n">gradlew</span> <span class="n">build</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>depending on the parrticular build system the project uses.</p>
<p>Notice that some projects might provide specific instructions on how
to build them, not following one of the patterns above. In this case,
you will need to provide the command line that is supposed to build
the project as a replacement of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;build-command&gt;</span></code> in the template
above. If the compilation of the project fails, you still might be
able to partially analyse it if adding the flag <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--keep-going</span></code> to
the command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">infer</span> <span class="pre">--racerd-only</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">infer</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">racerd</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">only</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">keep</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">going</span> <span class="o">--</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">build</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">command</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, you can also run Infer after the compilattion, by pointing it
correctly to the foldere with sources and the compiled
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.class</span></code>-files as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">infer</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">racerd</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">only</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">sourcepath</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">to</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">java</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">files</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">generated</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">classes</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">to</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">class</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">files</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<h2>Tips and Tricks<a class="headerlink" href="#tips-and-tricks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here are some hints and comments on how to approach this assignment.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is suggested that you team up with someone who uses a different
OS than you (e.g., Mac OS and Linux) to cater for the situations
when building a project or running Infer is impossible due to
system-specific reasons. It is perfectly fine if just one of the
teammates obtains the report, and they you split the workload on
code triaging for bugs.</li>
<li>Please, allocate sufficient time to install Infer and build some of
the projects and be prepared to resolve the issues with missing
libraries and/or dependencies. Solving those might take <strong>much
longer</strong> than you’d expect!</li>
<li>Your reported data race don’t have all come from the same project:
you may pick as many projects as necessary to describe in your
report.</li>
<li>You <strong>don’t</strong> have to understand what <cite>exactly</cite> the analysed code
does. It’s perfectly fine if you explain an error in terms of
fields/classes it affects, without explaining what purpose those
classes serve. It is, in fact, quite frequent in large development
to fix bugs in someone else’s code without fully understanding what
it does but just following some predefined strategies (nowadays some
bugs can be even fixed automatically!).</li>
<li>Beware that Infer/RacerD can give <cite>false positives</cite>, i.e., report
some code as being racy, whereas in fact it is not. If you manage to
identify such fragments (which is typically harder than confirming a
race) and provide reasoning on why a certain report is a false
positive, feel free to use it instead of one of the race report.
That said, <strong>at least one</strong> of your reports should be about what you
consider to be <strong>true race</strong> detected by the analyser.</li>
<li>Related to the previous, some of the races reported by the tool can
be <cite>benign</cite>, e.g., used for implementation of custom synchronisation
mechanisms via atomic or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">volatile</span></code> variable. If you manage to
identify any properly describe one of those, feel free to use it in
your report (instead of a proper data race report).</li>
<li>Infer/RacerD is just another program, and it may contain bugs
itself. Sometimes it might crash, in which case it is suggested you
abandon a specific project that causes it to do so and try another
one. Also, don’t spend too much time on a project you can’t compile.</li>
<li>When looking for more projects on GitHub that have concurrency in
them, it’s a good strategy to check if they use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">synchronized</span></code>
statements or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;ThreadSafe</span></code> annotations.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about confirming a data race reported by RacerD as a
true one (in case if it’s not). This is an exploratory project,
aimed to give you experience with bug detection at scale. That said,
you are expected to do your best when explaining the nature of the
bugs. Just copying-pasting RacerD report won’t do it.</li>
<li>Don’t worry if the legitimate data races you’re describing are not
so “interesting” and look like silly programming mistakes. Most of
the real-life bugs are quite silly (and if they weren’t we couldn’t
have nice automated tools that discover them so efficiently).</li>
</ul>
